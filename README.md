# Components
it's a site under construction whose goal is to serve as a showcase by showing my skills. I therefore develop small reusable components in each techno.

for now there are only components in HTML / CSS for which I have explored the use of sprites, animations, transitions, effects like parallax ....
I use flex, grids, pseudo-classes and I vary the CSS selectors to master them as well as possible.
to organize all this, I use SASS.

I will be starting components in JS soon.
then it will be the turn of PHP with BDD, Angular, NodeJS ....
